Project Overview
Welcome to our GitHub repository! This project harnesses the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to create a sophisticated risk estimation calculator designed specifically for evaluating the chronic critical illness (CCI) in patients with bone trauma. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a robust tool that can assist in clinical decision-making by accurately assessing patient risks based on various factors.
File Structure
This repository is organized into several key components, each serving a distinct purpose in the development and deployment of our risk estimation model. Below is a detailed description of the contents:
1. Jupyter Notebook
•	Modelling and validation.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook serves as the core of our machine learning workflow. Within this file, we outline the entire process of model development, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model training and validation. Key features of this notebook include:
•	Data Preprocessing: We provide a comprehensive approach to cleaning and transforming the dataset, including handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables. This ensures that the data fed into our models is of high quality.
•	Feature Engineering: We explore methods to create new features that enhance the model's predictive power. Techniques such as polynomial feature expansion and interaction terms are considered to capture complex relationships in the data.
•	Model Selection and Evaluation: The notebook includes a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and more. Each model is assessed using cross-validation techniques, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated. Visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of each model.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: We incorporate techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search to optimize the hyperparameters of our selected models, ensuring that we achieve the best possible performance before deployment.
2. R Language Scripts
To provide a deeper insight into model performance, we have included several R Markdown files that produce visualizations critical for understanding how well our models perform:
•	R-Decision tree.Rmd
This script contains an analysis using the Decision Tree algorithm, allowing us to visualize the structure of the decision tree and its predictive rules. We also present the importance of various features in making predictions, helping clinicians understand which variables most influence CCI risk.
•	R-KNN.Rmd
The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is analyzed here, with visualizations that demonstrate how well the model can discriminate between different outcomes. We also explore the impact of choosing different values for K on model performance.
•	R-lr.Rmd
This file discusses the application of Linear Regression, providing insights into the relationship between independent variables and the CCI outcome. We include diagnostic plots to check for linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.
•	R-RF.Rmd
In the Random Forest analysis, we present the ensemble learning approach and its ability to handle high variance. The script features visualizations that highlight the importance of each feature in the model, providing insights into the factors contributing to CCI risk.
•	R-SVM.Rmd
The Support Vector Machine model is evaluated here, showcasing its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. We visualize the decision boundaries and support vectors, providing clarity on how the model classifies different data points.
•	R-Xgbc.Rmd
The XGBoost model, known for its performance and speed, is analyzed in this script. We illustrate the benefits of using gradient boosting and display the model's feature importance to guide clinical focus on key risk factors.
3. AI Application Code
•	main.py
This Python script is the engine of our AI risk estimation calculator. It contains the code necessary to deploy the machine learning models as a web application. Key aspects of this script include:
•	Web Framework Implementation: Utilizing frameworks such as Flask or Streamlit, we create a user-friendly interface that allows clinicians to interact with our models seamlessly.
•	API Development: We implement RESTful API endpoints that enable the application to receive user inputs, process the data through the trained models, and return the risk assessment output in a structured format.
•	Model Integration: The script showcases how to load pre-trained models and apply them to new patient data in real-time, providing instant feedback to users.
4. Web Application
Upon successful deployment, Streamlit Sharing has provided a URL that serves as the gateway to our web-based risk estimation calculator. This URL is accessible to clinicians and stakeholders, facilitating the use of our AI-driven tool for CCI assessment in bone trauma patients. Key features of the web application include:
•	User Interface: The application boasts an intuitive layout designed for ease of use. Users can navigate through different sections and input relevant data with minimal effort.
•	Dynamic Input Options: On the left side of the application, users can select various model variables that reflect the patient's clinical profile. This flexibility allows for tailored risk assessments based on individual patient data.
•	Instant Risk Calculation: Once the user submits the input data, the application quickly processes the information and computes the CCI risk, displaying the results in a clear and concise format.
•	Comprehensive Risk Report: The application generates a detailed risk assessment report, summarizing the findings and providing actionable insights for clinicians. This report can be used as part of patient consultations to discuss potential risks and treatment options.
